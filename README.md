# TODO

### General
- save full state in local storage?
- state not normally saved to link but can be read from link (generated by a share button)
- get node/link font and opacity feedback
- hover effects
- mobile: needs to be able to drag nodes when zoomed out

### Sidebar
- add functionality to reset/auto/update buttons
- should the buttons be for each section instead?
- close sidebar when clicking outside, or pressing escape
- open sidebar when clicking on a node

### Forces
- lots and lots of sliders
- should we store the node positions in local storage?
- change center force calculation so its dependent on total mass, not just number of nodes/clubs/people

### Groups
- just copy obsidian way

### Labels
- sliders for font size and opacity for nodes and links based on zoom level
- node size, link width, link colour, cbs allowing for full theme customisation

### Data
- download currently used data
- allow user to upload their own data
- is it too much to allow user to edit data in-app?
- auto scrape data?
  - github actions? github workflows? what is the difference?
  - has github pages bypassed cors?
  - cors.io?
- will it be possible to merge data from multiple sources?
  - multiple sources: IDs are globally unique; user can edit source order
- add UUID to data file itself so site knows if data has changed
  - actually just use hash of data

### Search
- get feedback on styling
- improve desc_html on data side
  - add bolding, links, etc
  - images
- fuzzy search
- advanced filters (tags, degree, ...)
- temp highlight search result node
- results must show the roles of the person/club
